# Changelog

Every pull request that changes the app adds a section here for its new version. The section becomes the notes of the GitHub Release and shows up in the window's update dialog, so write it for users.

## 0.1.1

- The window now needs cornercase 0.13.1 or newer on every platform, the release that brings machines and routines; run `cornercase update` if yours is older, and the window says so when it is.

## 0.1.0

- The window tells you when a new version of it is out and shows what changed; on Windows and Linux it installs it and opens again on the tab you were on.
- First release: a native window for cornercase, drawn on the GPU with GPUI. Downloads for macOS (universal, 12 or later), Windows (x64) and Linux (x86_64). The macOS one is signed and notarized by Apple, so macOS only asks once whether to open an app downloaded from the internet; the Windows and Linux ones are not signed yet. It needs cornercase 0.12.234 or newer, 0.12.287 or newer on Windows.
