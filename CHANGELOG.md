# Changelog

Every pull request that changes what users see adds a line under Unreleased, written for them. A release renames that section to its version, and the section becomes the notes of its GitHub Release.

## Unreleased

- The window tells you when a new version of it is out and shows what changed; on Windows and Linux it installs it and opens again on the tab you were on.
- First release: a native window for cornercase, drawn on the GPU with GPUI. Downloads for macOS (universal, 12 or later), Windows (x64) and Linux (x86_64). The macOS one is signed and notarized by Apple, so macOS only asks once whether to open an app downloaded from the internet; the Windows and Linux ones are not signed yet. It needs cornercase 0.12.234 or newer, 0.12.287 or newer on Windows.
